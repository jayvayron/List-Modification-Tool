# List-Modification-Tool
Hi there,
This is a relatively detailed description on the project I've worked on since a couple of days. 

So, here's a long description about what this is about:

The main purpose of creating this was to help me out in storing my some of selected followers database manually with me in form of a list. But editing a text file, entering an username and then putting commas between them was a boring task. So I came up with an idea about creating this. Currently this is all I came up.

The working of this program is as follows:

The program searches for the specified file in the given directory (inside the code). If the file exists, the program opens the file and checks if the file is empty or not. If it's not empty, the program extracts the data into a variable, in a form of list. [NOTE: The program currenly can only export the files if they are in a list form. Otherwise results are not guarranteed.]
Else if the directory is empty, the program assigns an empty list value to the variable. And then you can add values inside the variable which is then automatically added to the text file, everytime you press the ENTER KEY.
Else if the directory doesn't exist, the program asks if you want to create the file or not.
If you type [Y] (Yes), the program creates the file.
If you type [N] (No), the program closes.
Currently it's a very basic program based on the things that I had learn't in past few months and I can apply. I'll add more features as I learn more concepts.

Any feedback or suggestions are highly appreciated. XD
Thank you!
